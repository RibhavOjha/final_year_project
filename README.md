## Reinforcement Learning
### Library Dependencies present in requirements.txt. 

 `train.py`: Use for training your Reinforcement Learning agent. \
 `eval.py`: For evaluating your trained RL agent. Use `env = YourEnvName(render_mode="human")` for visualisation. \
  `envs`: folder contains the environment with obstacles. 

## PID Control
Implemented in Matlab. 

## Hardware
Implemented the Agilicious hardware from scratch, doing the mechanical, electronic and software assembly. \
Due to safety considerations such as limited space and lack of safety hardware, we could not test the RL on Agilcious used for the racing drone. 
Instead, the RL was deployed on CrazyFlie, a much lighter, safer, but less robust drone platform.
